## ROAD ACCIDENTS DASHBOARD


## Introduction
Road Accidents Dashboard that we created to learn more about data visualization and data analysis! 🚘📊👨‍💻
Creating this dashboard with Excel has been a great learning experience for me. The dashboard provides real-time information about road accidents in the city of Pakistan. The dashboard includes information such as the total number of casualties that occurred in a given time period, the severity of the accidents, the location, the types of vehicles involved, and the number of injuries.
Through this project, I gained valuable skills in data visualization, dashboard, and analytics. I was also able to learn about the importance of road safety and how data analysis can be used to promote it.
